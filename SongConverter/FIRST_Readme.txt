Please input you'r Chrome version here = 

You can check you'r Chrome version by:
	1. Opening Chrome.
   	2. Then clicking on the 3 vertical dots in the upper right corner.
    	3. Then clicking onto "Help".
    	4. Then "About Chrome".
    	5. And then just by reading the first 2 digits of you'r Chrome version.

Instructions:
	1. After inputing the Chrome version into this txt file just save it and close it. 
	2. Run the "Video_Converter(Windows).exe", input song's Youtube url and press ENTER.
	3. Choose the download destination, wait for it to finish and you are done!
	Ps: You don't need to open "ChromeVersions" folder, only the program needs it.

If the program just crashes, then you have probablly inputed the wrong Chrome version.
If the program asks you for the firewall permission just ALLOW it because it needs it in order to donwload the song.

Thank you, and have fun!
